# React Native Playground

## Overview

This project is a learning and experimentation playground for exploring React Native, TypeScript, and cross-platform mobile development. It's designed to help developers understand the basics of building mobile applications using React Native while also incorporating TypeScript for improved type safety and developer experience.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

1. To learn and practice React Native development
2. To experiment with TypeScript in a React Native environment
3. To understand cross-platform development principles
4. To explore various React Native components and their usage

## Features

This experimental app includes:

- Multiple view components (Image, ImageBackground, ScrollView)
- Component toggling functionality
- Basic styling with React Native's StyleSheet
- TypeScript integration for improved code quality and developer experience

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the project with `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Project Structure

The project consists of:

- `App.tsx`: The main component that handles state and renders child components
- Three main components:
  - `ImageComponent`: Displays two images
  - `BackgroundComponent`: Shows an image background with text overlay
  - `ScrollableComponent`: Demonstrates a scrollable view with images and text

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, you can expect to gain insights into:

- React Native component structure and lifecycle
- State management in React Native applications
- TypeScript integration in React Native projects
- Cross-platform considerations in mobile app development
- React Native styling and layout techniques
